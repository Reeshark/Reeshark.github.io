I am Cong Ma (马璁), and I obtained my Ph.D. degree from [National Engineering Research Center of Visual Technology, Peking University](https://idm.pku.edu.cn/en) in 2021 advised by Prof. [Xiaidong Xie](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=9-s2WI8AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) and Prof. [Wen Gao](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=u9aw5o8AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao). I completed my bachelor's degree at [School of Artificial Intelligence, Xidian University](https://sai.xidian.edu.cn/) in 2016 supervised by Prof. [Licheng Jiao](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=FZbrL2YAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao). I received a visiting student researcher position at [Stanford Vision and Learning Lab](https://svl.stanford.edu/) under the supervision of Prof. [Silvio Savarese](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=ImpbxLsAAAAJ). 

Currently, I am working at [Sensetime](https://www.sensetime.com/en) where I lead a team dedicated to researching the Roadside Holographic Intersection Perception Algorithm such as 2D/Monocular 3D Detection, Lidar 3D Detection, Multi-Object Tracking, and Multi-Sensor Fusion. In addition to this role, I also serves as the Chief Technical Adviser for projects involving Smart-Surveillance Systems, Intelligent Transportation and Vehicle-Infrastructure Cooperation. I am leading a team consisting of two full-time employees, two internships, and six students, who are all dedicated to advancing the field of our projects. Together, we have been actively involved in cutting-edge research. 

In addition to my research contributions, I have served as a reviewer for prestigious journals and conferences, including IJCV, PR, TIP, TCSVT, AAAI, and ECCV and have reviewed a total of 24 papers. I was nominated for the prestigious ["Person of the Year"](http://stu.people.com.cn/GB/n1/2016/0429/c402103-28314575.html) award in 2016 during my college years.
